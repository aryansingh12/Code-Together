# Group Omega, CS 326, UMass Amherst, Website: CodeTogether

## Data interaction- From Milestone 0:

Innovative Idea - Our project is a tool to help business people and developers alike work on independent projects. For entrepreneurs, this will be where they find the coders for their "million dollar app idea". They can submit their idea and look for people to help them accomplish it. Developers can do the same if they're just looking for help with their latest project. The idea is for people to have an account that tells a little about their coding and project experience. User accounts can have a tag or description that shows past projects, coding languges known and at what level, project desires/needs, etc. We can allow people to search for others that they think could contribute on their project based on their skills, or we could implement a system that matches people with similar coding backgrounds if they don't want to do it manually. Ideally, this site greatly facilitates the creation of indepedent projects among developers and startups, as well as introduces the business aspect into it. As far as our group knows, there are not other sites that do what ours is designed to do, at least in this specific manner. Many other project finding resources are on a platform like Reddit that is not specifically designed to facilitate the creation of a project team. Our site can hopefully fill this role for people looking to start independent projects in a group.

Important Components - Some defining features include:
User profiles with the following info:
About section (as seen in wireframe):
- Coding experience (years, school, etc)
- Status (Whether or not you're looking for a project)
- What kind of project you'd want to work on, and with what type of people (using profile attributes ie. Looking for someone with 2 years python experience, etc.)
Past Projects section
Contact Info
Set of skill tags to show what technical skills they have that could be used for a project.
All of these as seen in the profile section wireframe, and HTML screenshot

Users can create a project post, defining the specifications of your project. Share the description, current contributers, status, and more. They can also view other projects in the same manner, with the same attributes.
Users will be able to search for and browse potential projects, filtering results as it suits them. The results will be filtered using the same skill tags mentioned in the profile section. (Seen in welcome page wireframe and HTML)

*Rough* Breakdown of work:  
index.html - TJ & Aryan  
profile.html - Ron  
create_project.html - Aryan & TJ  
project_description.html - Aryan  
login.html and signup.html - Ron  
extra.html - Aryan  
All CSS files related to these html files were, for the most part, worked on by the same people. Plus, some of the styling was done within the HTML with bootstrap.
