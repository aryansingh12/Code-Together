4. *Innovative Idea* - Our project is a tool to help business people and developers alike work on independent projects. For entrepreneurs, this will be where they find the coders for their "million dollar app idea". They can submit their idea and look for people to help them accomplish it. Developers can do the same if they're just looking for help with their latest project. The idea is for people to have an account that tells a little about their coding and project experience. User accounts can have a tag or description that shows past projects, coding languges known and at what level, project desires/needs, etc. We can allow people to search for others that they think could contribute on their project based on their skills, or we could implement a system that matches people with similar coding backgrounds if they don't want to do it manually. Ideally, this site greatly facilitates the creation of indepedent projects among developers and startups, as well as  introduces the business aspect into it. As far as our group knows, there are not other sites that do what ours is designed to do, at least in this specific manner. Many other project finding resources are on a platform like Reddit that is not specifically designed to facilitate the creation of a project team. Our site can hopefully fill this role for people looking to start independent projects in a group. 

5. *Important Components* - Some defining features include:
    - User profiles with the following info:
        - Coding experience (years, school, etc)
        - Past projects completed (Or GitHub)
        - Status (Whether or not you're looking for a project)
        - What kind of project you'd want to work on, and with what type of people (using profile attributes ie. Looking for someone with 2 years python experience, etc.)
    - Users can create:
        - Project post, defining the specifications of your project, whether it be independent or group-based
        - Comments on a project post, or a general post making general comments or seeking out project partners
        - Requests to join projects
    - We'll have both public and private projects. Public projects can be joined by anyone who meets a specific minimum requirement, private projects require the project creator to accept your request
    - Users will be able to search for and browse potential projects, filtering results as it suits them
    - Users can use a matching feature that will randomly put them in a project group that is looking for someone like them, and that they are looking for too
    - Messaging options between users would be ideal, but may be too hard to implement. The fix to this could be putting preferred contact info in each user's profile, so they can be contact on a different platform if needed
